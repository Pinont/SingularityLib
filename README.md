### Q&A

```
Q: Why was SingularityLib built so fast?

A: SingularityLib is a fork of ExperienceLib. It was developed with passion,
and the three years spent building the Minecraft plugin ExperienceLib provided a strong foundation.
Every time I discovered a new way to develop mechanics for Minecraft plugins,
it contributed to the knowledge base. So, when SingularityLib was built,
it already had a significant head start from the old project.
